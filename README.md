This repository contains source code to be compiled and run on a raspberry pico 2

The aim of this source code is to
- read temperature from the TMP117
- read magnetic strength in the x, y and z axis from the CMPS12
- read UVA, UVB, UVcomp1, and UVcomp intensity from the VEML6075
- read pressure (and possibly temperature) from the ICP10125
- read humitidy from the DollaTek humidity sensor
- save the measurements to the SD card
- Repeat several times
Hardware:
- TMP117 sensor
- CMPS12 sensor
- VEML6075
- ICP10125
- DollaTek humidity sensor
- SD card module
- Raspberry Pi Pico 2
