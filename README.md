This repository contains source code to be compiled and run on a raspberry pico 2

The aim of this source code is to
- read temperature from the TMP117
- read magnetic strength in the x, y and z axis from the CMPS12
- read UVA, UVB, UVcomp1, and UVcomp intensity from the VEML6075
- read pressure (and possibly temperature) from the ICP10125
- read humitidy from the DollaTek humidity sensor
- save the measurements to the SD card
- Repeat several times

**Upload Any Code Here Related to the following things above**
